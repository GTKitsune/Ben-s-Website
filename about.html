    <div id=boxes><h4>Benjamin Sequeira is South Florida based, Digital Illustrator, Machinamator, and Graphic Design. His Fine Art work deals with the ideals of blurring the line</br>
        between the real world and the virtual space, as well as raising the question in his work; whether videogames their communities mimic the real world or are they </br>
        truly part of it. "As we become a more technologically advance society, it becomes more intertwined with our everyday lives. Entire communities live sole through </br>
        the world wide web especially in video games such as MMO's. They do not mirror a society or mimic one, they are one."</br>

        and some prop work as part of his Digital Portfolio. Benjamin is a Highschool Graduate of The New World school of the arts, Visual arts Highschool program and is </br>
